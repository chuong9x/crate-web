Day 1 is almost over - time for a short blogpost, while the team enjoys some cheese and beer :)

## What have we been working on today?

  * **cratex:** Christian ([@apfelente](https://twitter.com/christianbader)) and Philipp ([@onkelbogi](https://twitter.com/onkelbogi)) started working on a native OSX Client for Crate.
  * Bernd ([@dobe](https://twitter.com/burndee)) and Basti ([@einsmu](https://twitter.com/einsmu)) are working on Crate **benchmarks**. Their [Python Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org) script It will make it supereasy to run them. E.g. to compare different Crate.
  * Hooray! Jürgen doubled the speed of **crate-python**. It seems that the requests library added some overhead and urllib3 is way faster.
  * The Admin UI finally got some long awaited features (thanks [@burnes_ernesto](https://twitter.com/burnes_ernesto)): The **SQL console** not has history support for executed SQL queries, including keyboard only support. It will also be possible to store queries in local storage for future reuse.
  * **User Defined Functions** (UDF) with Python looks really promising! Mathias ([@mfussenegger](https://twitter.com/mfussenegger)) and Bernd ([@quodt](https://twitter.com/quodt)) showed a working prototype that was able to execute UDFs.
  * More Languages! Christoph ([@corck](https://twitter.com/corck)) published the first [crate_ruby](http://rubygems.org/gems/crate_ruby) gem. It even supports BLOBs.
  * Conny, Manfred ([@schwendinger](https://twitter.com/schwendinger)) and Christian's ([@chaudum](https://twitter.com/chaudum)) Chrome extension "**Chromate**" is waiting for Googles approval. Thumbs up to see it appear in 24h. It's written in pure Javascript/HTML to monitor the health of your clusters from within the browser, provides critical information and enables you to quickly navigate to the admin interface of unhealthy clusters.
  * **craterl**  Not much more to say. Good job Peter ([@petersabaini](https://twitter.com/petersabaini)) and Matthias (@mwahl)!
  * Stephan and Igor connect **Node.js** and Crate. The combination of non-blocking JS and Crate looks really promising!
  * Last but not least - we now have a portable Testcluster powered by Intel NUCs!
