One of the best things about being an open source community is the unexpected contributions that appear.

One of our development team was following an issue for our [PHP PDO driver](https://github.com/crate/crate-pdo) when he noticed that a participant in the issue mentioned they had created a driver for [Laravel](http://laravel.com), a popular PHP framework.

The [Driver](https://github.com/RatkoR/laravel-crate.io) supports all latest versions of Laravel and supports *eloquent*, Laravel's ORM system. The driver supports creating and dropping scheme, full text search, querying, tests and much more.

It's developer, Ratko Rudiƒç has done a great job, so make sure any of you out there who are PHP developers [take a look](https://github.com/RatkoR/laravel-crate.io).
