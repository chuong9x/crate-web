We were thrilled to be invited to London to return the TechCrunch Disrupt Cup on the main stage. With thousands of attendees and hundreds of startups in attendance it was a great chance to check out the tech zeitgeist and all the latest innovations.

We couldn’t have asked for a nicer audience - it’s been a year but the reaction from the number and enthusiasm of people afterwards told us that Crate is still solving an important problem.

The TechCrunch battlefield is a great format that really encourages startups to pitch like they’ve never pitched before, and it was fantastic to see some of the startups competing this year - congratulations go to the eventual winner Jukedeck!

When we passed on the Cup we thought we'd make a video to show everyone what we got up to with the cup. We hope the winners will find as many good uses for it as we did!
