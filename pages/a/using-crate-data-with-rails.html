*This is a re-post of Christoph Klocker's post ["Using Crate With Rails"](http://vedanova.com/tech/open%20source/2014/06/24/using-crate-with-rails.html).*

If you don’t know [Crate](https://crate.io) yet, Crate is a document-oriented cluster data store that is easily scalable and comes with blob support. You simply start one or more instances and they automatically connect to each other and distribute your data to the different nodes. If you worked with replication and sharding before, you will love the simplicity of Crate. Crate is open source so just try it out.

In this guide I want to quickly walk you through getting Crate working with Rails using the [ActiveRecord adapter](http://rubygems.org/gems/activerecord-crate-adapter) I wrote.

## Installing Crate

First [Download Crate](/download) or install it through your favorite package manager or just simply execute the bash script in a terminal.

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -L try.crate.io)"
```

After downloading and unpacking it, simply start it

```sh
./bin/crate
```

And check if it’s running by opening the admin interface at

    http://localhost:4200/admin/

Great, now you have Crate up and running we are ready to use it as backend for Rails.

## Setup Rails

First create your new Rails project

```sh
rails new crate_rails
```

Now lets modify our Gemfile and exchange the sqlite gem with the activerecord-crate-adapter gem

```sh
# Gemfile
# Use crate as the database for Active Record
gem 'activerecord-crate-adapter'
```

Don’t forget to run bundle

```sh
bundle
```

Next modify your database.yml to connect to Crate. Crate does not support different database schemas so you need to have a separate Crate instance running on a different port for running your tests

```yaml
default: &default
adapter: crate
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 4200

development:
  <<: *default

test:
  <<: *default
  port: 4209
```

## Creating a simple recipe app

For this tutorial we are going to create a simple Recipe app. Each recipe should be assigned to one or more categories and have an ingredients list. For the categories and ingredients we are going to use Crate’s Array data type and for the properties, such as preparation time or calories we store them as an object. The aim of this tutorial is not to create a beautiful app, but to demonstrate using Crate as database and some of its key features, the array and object data type. Feel free to fork and play around.

Let’s use the scaffold to create our recipe app.


```rails
rails g scaffold recipe title:string description:string categories:array properties:object ingredients:array
```

We then need to modify the created migration and specify the object schema and schema type and the array type. So the migration looks like this


```rb
class CreateRecipes < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :recipes do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.string :description
      t.array :categories, array_type: :string
      t.object :properties, object_schema_behaviour: :strict,
               object_schema: {preparation_time: :integer, rest_time: :integer, calories: :integer}
      t.array :ingredients, array_type: :string
      # t.timestamp
      # Disabled due to a bug in AR adapter that does not set the timestamp automatically
    end
  end
end
```

Lets create a RecipeProperties class next, that we will serialize into the properties object column. The crate AR adapter comes with the CrateObject module that we can reuse. It provides us with two methods #dump and #load that does the serialization for us. All we need to do is to make all instance variables accessible and assign them on initialization. We also add the #to_s method for pretty printing in our views.

```rb
require 'active_record/attribute_methods/crate_object'
class RecipeProperties
  PROPERTIES = [:preparation_time, :rest_time, :calories]
  attr_accessor *PROPERTIES

  include CrateObject

  def initialize(opts = {})
    @preparation_time = opts[:preparation_time]
    @rest_time = opts[:rest_time]
    @calories = opts[:calories]
  end

  # Pretty print
  def to_s
    str = ""
    PROPERTIES.each do |property|
      str << "#{property.to_s.humanize}: #{send(property)}n"
    end
    str
  end
end
```

Next we will add the serialize functionality on the recipe model. At the same time we also add a before_validation to set a unique id, as Crate doesn’t support auto incrementation.

```rb
class Recipe < ActiveRecord::Base
  before_validation :set_id

  serialize :properties, RecipeProperties

  private
  def set_id
    self.id = SecureRandom.uuid
  end
end
```

That’s pretty much it for what we need to get started. Let’s tackle the controller and views

## Creating a new recipe

Let’s start with simply allowing to post a new recipe. We need to allow to set all properties attributes. Let’s modify the generated view and change the properties div to this

```rb
# view/recipes/_form.html.erb
<% props =  f.object.properties %>
<% RecipeProperties::PROPERTIES.each do |property| %>
  <div class="field">
    <%= label_tag property.to_s.humanize %><br>
    <%= text_field_tag "recipe[properties][#{property}]", props.send(property) %>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

and the div for the ingredients to this

```rb
<div class="field">
  <%= f.label :ingredients %><br>
  <% f.object.ingredients.try(:each) do |ingredient| %>
      <%= text_field_tag "recipe[ingredients][]", ingredient %><br>
  <% end %>
</div>
```

For the categories we want to use predefined values that are selectable. Lets add a constant to the recipe model

```rb
CATEGORIES = %w(breakfast dinner lunch)
```

And use it in the view

```rb
<div class="field">
  <%= f.label :categories %><br>
  <%= f.select :categories, Recipe::CATEGORIES, {:prompt => "Please select"}, multiple: true, size: 4 %>
</div>
```

In the controller we need to set a new RecipeProperties object for rendering the form, and some empty values for the ingredients field as well. (Adding more ingredients using Javascript is up to you, we limit it to 2 for this tutorial)

```rb
# GET /recipes/new
def new
  @recipe = Recipe.new(properties: RecipeProperties.new, ingredients: ["", ""])
end
```

On the controller side we need to parse the properties into the properties object.

```rb
def create
  @recipe = Recipe.new(recipe_params)
  @recipe.properties = RecipeProperties.new(params[:recipe][:properties])
  respond_to do |format|
    if @recipe.save
      format.html { redirect_to @recipe, notice: 'Recipe was successfully created.' }
      format.json { render :show, status: :created, location: @recipe }
    else
      format.html { render :new }
      format.json { render json: @recipe.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }
    end
  end
end
```

We also modify the strong parameters method recipe_params to allow our parameters.

```rb
def recipe_params
  params.require(:recipe).permit(:title, :description, properties: [:preparation_time, :rest_time, :calories, :difficulty], ingredients: [], categories: [])
end
```

Now we should be able to create new recipes. Give it a try.

## Updates

We also need to make a small adjustment on the controller update to allow updates of the properties.

```rb
def update
  p = recipe_params
  @recipe.properties = RecipeProperties.new(p.delete(:properties))
  respond_to do |format|
    if @recipe.update(p)
      format.html { redirect_to @recipe, notice: 'Recipe was successfully updated.' }
      format.json { render :show, status: :ok, location: @recipe }
    else
      format.html { render :edit }
      format.json { render json: @recipe.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }
    end
  end
end
```

Now we have updates working as well.

## Filtering

Now after we have all basic CRUD functionality working, lets create a simple filtering to demonstrate Crate’s strength in its native data types (array, object).

Let’s start with filtering by category. First we add a scope on the recipe model and then use it in the controller.

```rb
# recipe.rb
scope :by_category, ->(category) { where("'#{category}' = ANY (categories)")}

# recipes_controller.rb
def index
  @recipes = Recipe.all
  @recipes = @recipes.by_category(params[:category]) if params[:category]
end
```

Now we just need to add some links to the index view.

```rb
# recipes/index.html.erb
Filter by:
<% Recipe::CATEGORIES.each do |category| %>
  <%= link_to category, recipes_path(category: category) %>
<% end %>
<br/><br/>
```

People are lazy and only want to spend a certain amount of time to prepare their meals, so lets add a filter by preparation time.

```rb
# recipes/index.html.erb
Filter by max preparation time:
<% [30, 60, 90, 120].each do |time| %>
  <%= link_to "<#{time}",  recipes_path(max_preparation_time: time) %>
<% end %>
<br/>
```

In the recipe model we now query after the properties attribute preparation time. Crate lets us access the object attributes directly in a query.
The select would look like this:

```sql
SELECT recipes.* FROM recipes  WHERE (properties['preparation_time'] < 60)
```

So lets create a scope

```rb
# recipe.rb
scope :max_preparation_time, ->(time) { where("properties['preparation_time'] < #{time}")}
```

and use it in the controller:

```rb
@recipes = @recipes.max_preparation_time(params[:max_preparation_time]) if params[:max_preparation_time]
```

If you refresh the index page you can filter by preparation time.

## Summary

In a quick recap: Instead of creating a separate table for defining categories we store them directly as an Array on the recipe table. Properties are stored as an object what helps us to not have an endless set of columns on the recipe table or using a new property table that we would then join.
