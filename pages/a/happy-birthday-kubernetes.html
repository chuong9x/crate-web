title: Happy Birthday Kubernetes!
author: Claus Matzinger
description: In July Kubernetes celebrated their first birthday with events around the globe. Crate took this opportunity to run a Hackathon entirely based around Crate and Kubernetes in Berlin.

During the [Endocode][1]'s Kubernetes birthday party on 21 July, we came up with the idea to kickstart our Kubernetes support with a Hackathon! As Google's partner in Europe Endocode agreed to hosting this event and supplying us with information and, most importantly, drinks. Google also sent us some T-Shirts and loads of stickers (Thanks!).

With more than 20 registrations on our [meetup event](http://www.meetup.com/CrateIO-Usergroup-Berlin/events/232774269/) we were looking forward to a fun Saturday afternoon, with all kinds of learnings about different projects and applications for Kubernetes (and maybe Crate).

Endocode welcomed us even before noon in order to do the basic set up: Prepare T-Shirts, stickers, and food. As an alternative to the usual pizza, Healthy Hackers provided pulled pork/beef, vegetables, bread, and cake during the afternoon.

After some initial presentations about the fundamentals of Crate and Kubernetes, we started hacking right away with an introductory lecture of Kubernetes and after a couple of minutes the first clusters were spawned on Google Container Engine. As the day went on, Julian (the Kubernetes expert from [Endocode][1]) answered hundreds of different questions on node discovery, persistent storage, load balancing, PetSets, templates, and [Kubernetes][2] in general.

Afterwards people started working on their projects which ranged from a simple setup with [Kubernetes][2] to a full-blown deployment of a service to do video animation.

Crate's team created a reference [Kubernetes][2] template (coming later this week) that that provides a good starting point for managing production infrastructure.

All in all it was great fun and we hope to welcome even more people next time to play with different technologies and gain insights into more interesting projects!
