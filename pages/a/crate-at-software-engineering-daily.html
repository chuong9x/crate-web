*An interview with Jodok Batlogg by Jeff Meyerson on [Software Engineering Daily](http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/).*

The driver for the [Crate](https://crate.io) open source project was the limited scalability of existing database technologies, when Jodok, Christian and Bernd were dealing with large amounts of data themselves.  In 2010 they discovered ElasticSearch, a project - developed only by one person - based on Java’s Netty featuring  a great architecture which sparked the inspiration for the solution of their big data problems.Built with ElasticSearch at its core, Crate is a distributed SQL database that sports a custom, distributed query engine to provide high scalability and performance.


Moreover, Jodok and Jeff Meyerson talk about how an average company runs several databases for different applications – for example, MySQL for relational data, MongoDB as a document database, HDFS for blob storage and data warehouse, etc. Crate’s approach: Blend them together to simplify their usability!


Find out about the foundation, features, use cases (e.g. IoT backend, analytical workloads), and trade-offs of Crate compared to other databases, how it runs in a containerized ecosystem, tools that are powered by Crate (e.g. visualization and data ingestion tools) and much more [in 53 minutes](http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/05/12/crate-io-distributed-sql-jodok-batlogg/)!
