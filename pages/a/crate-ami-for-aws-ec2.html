AWS EC2 has always been a popular option with Crate users for deploying their instances and we use the service for our own test and demo clusters.

An AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a pre-configured virtual appliance optimized for a particular use. With the Crate AMI, this includes dependencies, optimization and configuration to get Crate running as quickly and efficiently as possible.

The AMI is based on Amazon Linux and can be found (and launched) through the AWS web interface or CLI tool.

For more details on the Crate AMI and best practices for using it, [read our documentation](/docs/en/latest/best_practice/crate_ami.html). If you have any feedback or problems, please [get in touch](/about/contact/).
