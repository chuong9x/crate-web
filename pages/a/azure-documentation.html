We have had requests from many of you about the potential of running Crate on Azure cloud hosting and/or Windows. Whilst this was always possible with some exploration, we now have official documentation.

Currently, we have documentation for running [Crate on Linux with Azure](/docs/install/cloud/azure/) and running [Crate on Windows with Azure](/docs/install/cloud/azure/#azure-windows).

Our plan is to next create documentation for running Crate on Windows Server independent of Azure and create an official Crate Azure image, but hopefully this will be enough to get you started.

We would welcome any feedback or problems you may experience, so please [get in touch](/about/contact/) if you have any.
