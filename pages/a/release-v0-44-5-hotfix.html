CrateIO is pleased to announce our latest release, Crate version `0.44.5`.  As always, you can find a summary of changes in the [CHANGES.txt](https://github.com/crate/crate/blob/master/CHANGES.txt) file in our GitHub repository.  We strive to make updating to our latest releases seamless and straightforward.  If you find this to not be the case, please don't hesitate to [contact us](/about/contact/) and let us know. 

**This release includes a few significant fixes related to shards and partitions as well as an upstream upgrade to ElasticSearch version `1.3.4`.**

## Details

**First we'll start with what's been fixed:**

    FIXED: Trying to copy out of a non-existent partition now throws an exception.
    FIXED: Some shard errors were not being raised and so the shard failed silently when some kind of errors occurred, e.g. Out of Memory error. 

**Then, some new features were added:**

    UPGRADE: Elasticsearch was upgraded upstream to v1.3.4
    
That’s all we have to report today, see you next release!
