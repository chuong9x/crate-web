# Crate Secures $4M Seed Funding to Further Development of Distributed SQL database for Containerized Architectures

## Investors in next generation SQL database are Dawn Capital, Sunstone Capital, Draper Esprit, Speedinvest, and Solomon Hykes, creator and CTO of Docker

**London &amp; Berlin (March 15, 2016)** – [Crate Technology](https://www.crate.io), a distributed SQL database for containerized architectures, today announced that it has received a $4M investment led by Dawn Capital and joined by existing investors Sunstone Capital, Draper Esprit and Speedinvest. Solomon Hykes, creator of the Docker project, also participated in the round.

### Leveraging the Versatility of SQL

Crate is an open-source SQL database that is highly available, scalable and based on a shared-nothing masterless architecture, enabling significant performance increases over competing solutions. It offers the scalability and simplicity of NoSQL, but can be accessed through standard SQL, preserving investments in application code. Designed for ad-hoc queries and dynamic schemas, Crate is perfectly suited for the needs of hyper-growth applications in IoT, security and the web. 

Crate is generally available, and has been downloaded more than 350,000 times in the last six months. Crate production clusters now process billions of daily inserts, serving real-time search and aggregations on trillions of documents.

“Crate´s simplicity and masterless architecture make it a perfect match for containerized environments,” Solomon Hykes, founder and CTO of Docker. “I expect to see it widely deployed as more developers adopt the new microservices paradigm.”

Sekhar Sarukkai, Skyhigh’s Chief Scientist and co-founder said: “We’re using Crate in production, supporting the massive growth of our cloud-app security offering. Crate´s real-time SQL aggregations, its simple scalability and high availability make it a key element of our stack. Its distributed SQL engine allows simple adoption in any enterprise.”

“The next logical stride after application containers is distributed database containers. The market is telling us that operational and analytics requirements are converging – people want to use one database for both needs,” said Christian Lutz, co-founder and CEO of Crate. “This and our distributed SQL engine have spurred several massive deployments of Crate with enterprises, and the new investment will allow us to continue our aggressive growth, add more features and support our growing community of users.”

Ari Helgason of Dawn Capital said: “At Dawn, we have a particular interest in open source businesses, and the usage growth seen by Crate over the past year is exceptional. The company has assembled a world-class team and we are excited about joining forces with them and supporting them as they expand their customer base around the world.”

The round will serve to grow market penetration as well as development of Crate’s core distributed SQL technology. Ari Helgason from Dawn Capital will join the board.
