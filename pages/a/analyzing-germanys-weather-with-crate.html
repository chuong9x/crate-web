The german weather service, [DWD](http://www.dwd.de/), publishes a vast amount of data measured at german weather stations. The data is available in monthly, daily and hourly intervals from the beginning of recorded official measurements. Temperature, humidity, cloudiness, precipitation, air pressure, soil temperature, sunshine duration, radiation, wind speed and direction and sun zenith are measured.

I decided I would write a blog post about my experiments importing their 236 million rows of data into Crate.
