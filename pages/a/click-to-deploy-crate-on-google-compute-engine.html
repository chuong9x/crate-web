*Please note that despite our best efforts, the Crate image is no longer available on Google Compute Engine. You should still be able to use compute instances to run Crate manually.*

The Crate.io team is happy to announce that it is now even easier to start a Crate cluster on Google Cloud Platform.

After collaborating with the engineers at Google, Crate is now officially available as a Click-To-Deploy database for Google Compute Engine.  Having a GCE click-to-deploy really emphasizes two key features of Crate:

- <strong>Ease of use</strong> - Using the point and click provisioning tool a Crate cluster can be up and running in minutes.
- <strong>Scalability</strong> - The only limit to the size of a cluster is the available compute resources of the project (easily addressed with a <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/1vb2MkAr9JcHrp6myQ3oTxCyBv2c7Iyc5wqIKqE3K4IE/viewform">project quota increase</a>).

The point and click provisioning of a Crate cluster is as simple as filling out these six fields.

You can [get started with Crate on Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/launcher/details/click-to-deploy-images:crate?q=crate) right now!
