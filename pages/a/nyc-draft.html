> "New York, New York!"

The city so iconic, popular and well known, they named it twice. Hundreds of films have depicted New York, generally being destroyed by a form of monster or invader. It has landmarks that are World famous, and [nearly 60 million visitors a year](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/nyregion/record-number-of-tourists-visited-new-york-city-in-2015-and-more-are-expected-this-year.html?_r=0).

But as the most populous city in the USA (Over 20 million in the Metropolitan area) that spans 470 square miles and 230 miles of dark, mysterious subway. It can be a daunting city for visitors, full of hidden delights and dangers.

Fortunately [New York City is a big supporter of open data](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/), so we decided to put Crate to the test and analyze these data sets to spot trends, patterns and help a keen visitor learn of the secrets that lurk in the Big Apple.
