Database performance depends on many factors. There are many
parameters user can tweak, but the outcome in complex setups is not
always obvious. While we had a big cluster of crate instances
available, we faced the challenge to load huge amounts of data into it
to initialize the distributed database. A series of experiments
resulted in an awesome 4.8 mio records/rate of ingesting data into our
cluster! To get there, we explored the effect of network connections,
number of nodes, and shard configuration.

## Setup

We used the [Azure](https://crate.io/docs/install/cloud/azure/)
platform, kindly provided by Microsoft for the evaluation to build a
set of strong [G-series
VMs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/tag/g-series/) to generate
test data that was sent to our cluster of crate instances. The
database cluster consisted of three master nodes for the purpose of
monitoring and propagating cluster changes. In our setup they
effectively had only work to do during the setup of the cluster since
after that they mostly idled during the experiment. A small cluster of
Ganglia nodes took care of the performance monitoring.

We chose [D12v2 nodes as VM
types](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/)
for the data nodes (as well as the master nodes). They come with four
cores, 28 GB RAM, and 200 GB local SSD storage.  We assigned half of
total RAM to the Crate heap and left the other half of the memory for
Lucene to leverage the underlying OS for caching in-memory data
structures. The following memory split guarantees the optimal Crate
performance.  Local attached storage is crucial for good crate
performance. Our SSD had been specified with 12,000 iops.

The even bigger G3 VMs created a simple table on the cluster like
this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE loadtest (
    data string)
CLUSTERED INTO x SHARDS WITH (num_of_replicas=0, refresh_interval=0);
```

As the number of shards ("*x*") needs to be defined at table creation
time, we ran a number of tests with different configurations. We've
got good results with twice the number of shards as the number of data
nodes, as a rule of thumb: A higher number of shards enables the
cluster to better distribute the data to the nodes and thus balance
the load over the cluster. With too many shards, the overhead eats up
that advantage, though. We discuss this factor in more detail later on
in this article.

We tweaked a few extra options when we created the table: To just
measure ingest performance, we turned off
[replication](https://crate.io/docs/reference/sql/reference/create_table.html#number-of-replicas)
as well as the [refresh
mechanism](https://crate.io/docs/reference/sql/refresh.html) during
the test. In production environments you should certainly turn that on
again after ingestion.

## Pump it up!

The python powered load generation machines produced a long series of
bulk insert request like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO loadtest (data)
VALUES('1st random data string of n bytes',
       '2nd random data string of n bytes',
       '...',
       'mth random data string of n bytes');
```

Our reference setup was inserting 1000 times 512 bytes in one batch,
resulting in 2.5 MB per bulk insert. There is a huge difference in
inserting one thousand times a single record compared to inserting all
of them in a single request: Aparat from the overhead imposed by
connection handling, when doing bulk operations the plan for the
statement needs to be generated only once and can then be executed
with different values.

## Merge larger segments

Whenever time permits, Crate [merges data structures called segements
to improve read
performance](https://crate.io/docs/reference/best_practice/data_import.html#store-level-throttling). To
ensure that requests are processed with reasonable response times, the
amount of I/O bandwidth dedicated to this background process is
limited. But as we had lots of bandwith available and we decided that
there was no need to process other queries while we loaded our
cluster, we set `store.throttle.max_bytes_per_sec` to `700mb` [during
the import](https://crate.io/a/optimize-big-clusters/).

With `memory.index_buffer_size: 25%` Crate allocates the certain
percentage of the total heap for the indexing buffer. The store module
controls how index data is stored and accessed on disk. The `mmapfs`
option for `index.store.type` configures the Lucene index to make use
of the buffer cache of the operating system when writing indices. And
finally `bootstrap.mlockall: true` makes the JVM lock its memory and
thus prevent it from being swapped by the operating system.

It is a real challenge to actually feed the Crate database cluster
with enough data. Our threaded python generator opened 1,024 sessions
to the endpoint in parallel (spawning 32 processes each with 32
threads) and repeated that procedure 50 times. Especially creating the
bulk request takes some time in the Python script.

To measure the performance of the cluster and not the client
libraries, we delivered the SQL statement directly to the HTTP
endpoint of the data nodes. The load generators connected to the data
nodes of the cluster in a round robin fashion.

That way we transmitted roughly 24 GB net data to our cluster
consisting of initially 14 data nodes, resulting in 51,2 million
records in the Crate cluster. Doing so takes about half a minute and
eventually results in 1,60 million records per second. This was our
reference value to beat.

## Increasing the number of data nodes

One obvious approach is to add more data nodes to the cluster. The
reference setup had 14 modes with 12,000 iops each. We configured 28
shards, resulting in 1.85 million records per second. Could we improve
if we doubled that? Indeed, as the same setup with 28 data nodes and
56 shards accelerates the ingestion rate to 3.01 million records per
second (see figure 1). Performance definitely benefits from horizontal
scaling the data nodes. The gain is slightly sub-linear since there is
some overhead in sending the data to its final shards. We are pretty
sure that we still could tweak here a little more to squeeze out a few
extra 100,000 records per second if we spent more time to find the
best fine-tuning of the bulk size at the load generator, but we chose
to focus in the cluster this time.

# In search of key factors

While it's easy to understand that more workers finish a given job
more swiftly, we wondered how adjusting the way they work affects
their performance. A crucial question is to decide the number of
shards in a table. Since [their number needs to be defined at creation
time of a
table](https://crate.io/docs/reference/sql/reference/create_table.html#clustered-clause),
we examined the effect of different setups in a large cluster. Roughly
we got best results having at least two shards per node (see figure 2).

![Figure 2: Tuning ingest performance depending on number of shards. These setup was done with a 14-node-cluster with different number of shards.]({% media '/media/0104/ingest-fig-2.png' %})

DBAs should act with caution, though. Finding the sweet spot depends
both on the actual data schema as well on the hardware parameters. As
a rule of thumb, you should try to keep all your drives spinning (even
if there's nothing more to move in a SSD nowadays), to get the best
out of your I/O bandwidth. Reading is adding another aspect:
Especially with aggregations your cluster nodes get some work to do
and you should try to keep your cores under fire in those
situations. The nodes in our test case had four cores each, so read
performance might benefit from some additional shards, but here we've
been optimizing for write throughput and thus had best results with 48
shards.

## Conclusion

Ingestion rates depend on many factors, the number of data nodes
having the most important impact. A good choice of shards also affects
the performance in a noteworthy way. Finally, the hardware specs of the
nodes themselves obviously also affect your results: Look out for lots
of iops and a balanced amount of CPU and memory. All that taken into
account we've been able to ingest up to 4,800,750.12 records/sec on a
cluster of 56 D14v2 nodes with 16 cores each. Cool.
