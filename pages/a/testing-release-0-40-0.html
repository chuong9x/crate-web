We're happy to announce a new testing release of Crate!

**Version 0.40.0** ships with a lot of great features, such as **`INSERT` by query**, **load metric** expressions on `sys.nodes`, **`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`** support, geo scalar functions (**`DISTANCE`, `WITHIN`**), **`IS NULL`** filter on columns of any types, and an updated ElasticSearch version (`1.2.2`).

Here is the full change log: 

    * COPY FROM / COPY TO: allow importing from and exporting to s3 without access credentials (only to / from public resources)
    * improved the clean up of distributed query execution if some part of the operations couldn't be executed due to resource exhaustions
    * performance improved of scalar function substr
    * updated crate-admin to 0.9.0 which contains following changes
    * use new sys.nodes.fs expression in order to calculate disk utilization of data disks correctly
    * changed sys.nodes.fs column to contain stats about all mounted disks, total disk stats and node data path locations
    * changed output of colum names in information schema to subscript notation
    * implemented sys.nodes.process expressions
