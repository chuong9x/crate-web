Version 0.55 of Crate introduces a lot of great features, fixes and changes.
Some of these required making changes to our code base that require extra steps
to upgrade your clusters than with previous Crate versions.

**Note**: Upgrading to 0.55 is only supported from Crate 0.52 and upwards.

## Preparation

Before upgrading a cluster it's strongly advised to [create a
backup](https://crate.io/a/backing-up-and-restoring-crate/) of your current
tables so you can always return to what you had before. Furthermore be prepared
to restart your entire cluster.

## Index Changes

Because of the Elasticsearch version upgrade, indices are not backwards
compatible to 0.54. Be aware that once upgraded to 0.55, using the same index
files in a 0.54 cluster will yield an error:

```bash
[2016-07-22 11:58:12,931][ERROR][gateway.local.state.shards] [Brian Braddock]
failed to read local state (started shards), exiting...
org.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchException: unexpected field in shard state
[index_uuid]
...
```

## Settings Changes

There have been several changes and deprecations to the following settings
in 0.55, some due to the underlying upgrade to Elasticsearch, and others
made for reliability.

### Configuration File and Location

You can no longer specify the name or location of the Crate configuration file
with the `CONF_FILE` environment variable, `-Des.config`, `-Des.default.config`,
or `-Delasticsearch.config` parameters. You must call it _crate.yml_ and locate
it in the _config_ directory, or another directory specified by the `CONF_DIR`
environmental variable, or by the `-Des.path.home` parameter. The file must be a
yaml file that ends in the _.yml_ extension.


### Units Required

You must now define units for time or byte based settings. This affects
Settings such as `cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low` for [defining
the lower disk threshold limit](/docs/reference/configuration.html#disk-based-shard-allocation)
for shard allocations, or `cluster.graceful_stop.timeout` for [defining the
maximum wait in milliseconds for reallocation processes to
finish](/docs/reference/configuration.html#graceful-stop). Please update your
configuration accordingly.

For example:

```yaml
cluster.graceful_stop.timeout: 1h
# Not…
cluster.graceful_stop.timeout: 1
...
cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low: 250mb
# Not…
cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low: 250
```

### Translog Syncing

The `gateway.local.sync` setting for controlling the period after which the
translog is synced to disk has been renamed to `translog.sync_interval`.

### Bulk Operations

The `bulk.partition_creation_timeout` setting has been removed.

### Automatic Job Termination

The `jobs.keep_alive_timeout` setting has been removed, meaning that you are no
longer able to enable automatic job termination based on defined rules.

## Other Changes

### Crate Does Not Start on Plugin Errors

If one of your plugins does not load properly, Crate will now refuse to start.
To remedy this, please remove any broken plugins from the [plugins
folder](https://crate.io/docs/reference/plugins.html).

### Disallowing "." Character in Field Names

Tables with column names that contain a dot are now disallowed. Consider
re-creating the table and migrating the data via [insert by
query](https://crate.io/docs/reference/sql/dml.html#inserting-data-by-query).

```bash
2016-07-22 11:25:15,651][ERROR][gateway] [Solo] failed to read local state,
exiting...
java.lang.IllegalStateException: unable to upgrade the mappings for the index
[stocks], reason: [Field name [adj. close] cannot contain '.']
```
