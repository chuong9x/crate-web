**This release includes a few fixes and we reduced memory consumption for certain statements.**

## Details

**First we'll start with what's been fixed:**

    FIXED: non-matching global aggregates on partitioned tables failed.
    FIXED: handle boost factor in simple match predicate correctly.
    FIXED: requests that resulted in a shard failure could cause a NPE during the generation of the error message.

    IMPROVED: Reduced memory consumption during execution of regular SELECT statements.
