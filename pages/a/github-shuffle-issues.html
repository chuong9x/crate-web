# Please shuffle our issues!

As our Product an reach is growing and growing so is our Community. A lot of people participate in conversations on Github, Slack, Stackoverflow and other channels. The community is sharing a lot of thoughts with us and we are listening. 

We don't only discuss how to optimize clusters and help people get started, we also discuss new features.

This discussion should be more public, that's why we created the "shuffle" Tag. Those are issues that are heavily discussed within and around Crate and probably might be part of Crate in the nearer or farer future.

Feel free to comment and upvote those Issues like all of the others too.
