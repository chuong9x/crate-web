## Details

**Some new features were added:**

    NEW: Support explicit type conversion using cast expression.
    NEW: All scalar functions can now be used in the WHERE clause in SELECT statements and they may be nested without limitations. In addition it is now possible to compare one scalar function to another.
    NEW: Added support to compare one column with another in the WHERE clause for SELECT statements.
    NEW: Implemented regular expression scalar functions and query operator.
    NEW: Support for accessing items in an array. Please refer to the ``Crate SQL -> Querying Crate -> Retrieving Data -> Object Arrays`` documentation section for details and limitations.
    NEW: Renamed NullType to UndefinedType in order to avoid confusion about its usage.
