Crate is mostly configured via [a settings file or when launched on the command line via arguments](https://crate.io/docs/reference/configuration.html). You can use Crateâ€™s SQL interface to change certain settings at runtime using the [SET / RESET commands](https://crate.io/docs/reference/sql/reference/set.html). The settings that can be changed are marked with `Runtime: yes`.
