Yes. There are several projects that do that. We verified Crate working well with including, but not limited to Metabase, Tableau, Stream Sets, Kibana, Zoom Data, XXX, and YYY. Several other tools may work as well as we provide JDBC and ODBC (only with support contract) client drivers that most of these tools require.
