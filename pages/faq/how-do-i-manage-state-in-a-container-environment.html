We recommend spinning up one Crate container on each container host. That means that each node can use as much local I/O as available as well as providing a network-local connection to the ephemeral data layer, where all ephemeral containers can store their state. If you configure a sensible number of replicas, a single data container can also be used in a ephemeral way.
