Replication of a table in Crate means that each primary shard of a table is also stored on so called secondary shards, and is useful for better read performance and high availability. If unspecified, Crate creates one replica, which means that table content is stored twice across the nodes of a cluster.

It's important to set the number of replicas as low as possible, ideally to zero.

Read more about replication syntax [here](/docs/reference/sql/ddl.html#replication) and our best practice guide [here](/docs/reference/best_practice/data_import.html#shards-replicas).
