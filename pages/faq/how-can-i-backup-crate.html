Crate has a convenient `CREATE SNAPSHOT` SQL command that stores the current state of one or all tables into a backup store. There are drivers for several stores available, including local file system, an Amazon S3 storage, or HDFS. For more details see the [documentation](/docs/reference/sql/snapshot_restore.html).
