To make it short: More is better. This both applies to the configuration of the single node Crate runs on as well as the number of nodes. For a useful production environment you should have several GB of RAM, 4 cores, and a decent SSD drive in a node. At least a five node cluster is recommended if you attach importance to resilience and performance. For special needs other values may apply. The technical mimimum are a single core, 40 MB of RAM for the application and a disk, but that makes obviously not much sense for most setups. Although several independent host nodes are recommended, a small Crate cluster easily runs on a single developer notebook for testing purposes.
