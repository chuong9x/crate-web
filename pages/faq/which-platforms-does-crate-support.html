The Crate core is written in Java and runs whenever a Java Runtime Environment (up from Java 8) is available. Additional to the base package, there are self contained packages available for several Linux distributions, container and virtualization environments. A support contract with SLAs is available for a number of Enterprise Linux distributions. For other base platforms Crate is supported on a best effort base.
