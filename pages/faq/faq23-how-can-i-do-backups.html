There is the convenient `CREATE SNAPSHOT` SQL command that stores the current state of one or all tables into a backup store. There are drivers for several stores availbale, including a local file system, an Amazon S3 storage, or HDFS. For more details see our [documentation](https://crate.io/docs/reference/en/latest/sql/snapshot_restore.html).
