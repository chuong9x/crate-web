Crate's most performant client driver is [Java](/docs/clients/java/), but we also officially maintain libraries for [PHP](/docs/clients/php), [Python](/docs/clients/python), [Erlang](/docs/clients/erlang) and ODBC (with [enterprise](/contact) contract). The Crate community has contributed many [drivers](/docs/clients/) and we also provide an [HTTP endpoint](docs/clients/rest/).
