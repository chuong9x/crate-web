The memory footprint of Crate depends mostly on the results (and size) of a query. Crate doesn't have a traditional index structure retained in memory, but instead uses the inbuilt caching that Lucene leverages from the Operating System. We have a more [detailed guide to memory handling here](https://crate.io/docs/reference/configuration.html#crate-heap-size).
