Yes, we have users that [connected Crate to Kibana](http://techblog.bigdata-analyst.de/2015/06/25/how-to-use-kibana-4-with-crate-io/) by means of the `es.api`. We are currently adding support for Metabase, which is a query manager and visualization BI tool. That should become available in a few days. This is a helpful toolchain for users who want to run custom queries. There are other visualization tools available, too.
