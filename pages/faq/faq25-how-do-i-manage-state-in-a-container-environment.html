We advise to spin up one Crate container on each container host. That means that each node can use as much local I/O as available as well as providing a network-local connection to the ether-like data layer. There all ephemeral containers can store their state. If you configure a sensible number of replicas, the single data containers can also be used in a emphemeral way.
