Crate can't do transactions, but implements eventual consistency. Not all forms of JOINs are supported as part of the database as this is expensive. [Cross and inner joins are supported](https://crate.io/a/sql-for-elasticsearch), though. Having these features is intrinsically expensive in terms of execution of INSERT and query performance. However, we are adding more and more features as time goes by.
