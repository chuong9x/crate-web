Yes, that is [possible](https://crate.io/docs/reference/best_practice/migrating_from_mysql.html), as long as just data is imported, that is the easy part. We don't have support for stored procedures, though. Eventually it all depends on the specific data. We have, like PostgreSQL, geospatical support for attributes. You may or may not require to do some reformatting.
