Yes, we have users that [connect to Crate with Kibana](http://techblog.bigdata-analyst.de/2015/06/25/how-to-use-kibana-4-with-crate-io/) with the `es.api`. We are currently adding support for Metabase, which is a query manager and visualization BI tool. There are other visualization tools also available.
