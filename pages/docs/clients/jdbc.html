title: Connecting to Crate with JDBC
author: Chris Ward


## Compatibility

To find out which drivers are compatible to your Crate version, please consult
the [reference documentation](https://crate.io/docs/reference/jdbc/).

## Add Crate to your Project
A simple way to configure your project to connect to a Crate cluster is to
visit the JDBC driver page on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/crate/crate/crate-jdbc/view)
and click the *Set Me Up* button. This will give you a Maven or Gradle
configuration that can be pasted into your current project or downloaded for a
new project.

For manual configuration follow these steps depending on your build system
of choice.

### Maven
Add the following to your *pom.xml* file:

```xml
...
<repositories>
    ...
    <repository>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
        </snapshots>
        <id>central</id>
        <name>bintray</name>
        <url>http://dl.bintray.com/crate/crate</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
...
<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.crate</groupId>
        <artifactId>crate-jdbc</artifactId>
        <version>VERSION</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
...
```

### Gradle
Add Crate as a dependency to your Gradle file:

```groovy
   repositories {
        ...
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        compile 'io.crate:crate-jdbc:VERSION'
        ...
    }
```

## Connect to Crate

Connect to Crate Cluster with the Java DriverManager:

```java
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("crate://SERVER_IP:5432/");
```

- More detailed documentation on the Crate JDBC client is available [here](/docs/reference/jdbc).
- The **Crate Sample App** demonstrates features of Crate and
[how to use them in a JDBC based application](https://github.com/crate/crate-sample-apps/tree/master/java)
with an explanation of how the library is used
[here](https://github.com/crate/crate-sample-apps/blob/master/java/documentation.md).
