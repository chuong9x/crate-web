title: Install Crate on Linux
author: Chris Ward

Crate maintains official packages for Arch Linux, Debian, RedHat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu. We recommend you use our 1-step installer that will configure the appropriate package repository and install Crate for you.

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -L install.crate.io)"
```

If you like to do things manually, here's how.

## Arch Linux

Crate publishes build files to [Arch Linux AUR](https://aur4.archlinux.org/packages/crate/). If you have any problems installing packages from the AUR, full instructions are available on the Arch Linux [Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_User_Guidelines)). Make sure you have installed `build base-devel` with the `pacman -S --needed base-devel` command.

### Download the package

```bash
mkdir ~/builds
cd ~/builds
curl -O https://aur4.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/crate.tar.gz
tar xzvf crate.tar.gz
```

### Build and install the package

```bash
cd crate
makepkg -si
```

### Start Crate

```bash
sudo systemctl enable crate.service
sudo systemctl start crate.service
```

## Debian

We provide Debian packages for the Wheezy (7.x) and Jessie (8.x) distributions. To install Crate from our repository requires a couple of steps.

The first two steps are identical for both distributions.

### 1\. Install https support for apt

```bash
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
```

### 2\. Download and install GPG key:

```bash
wget https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/DEB-GPG-KEY-crate
sudo apt-key add DEB-GPG-KEY-crate
```

### Debian Wheezy

#### 3\. Install Java 8

Wheezy does not officially ship with Java 8, so you have to install it via a 3rd party repository, e.g. provided by **webupd8team**:

```bash
echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu precise main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
echo "deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu precise main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys EEA14886
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
```

#### 4\. Add Crate repository to sources list

Next, add the Crate repository to _/etc/apt/sources.list_.

##### Stable Releases

```bash
deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/stable/ wheezy main
deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/stable/ wheezy main
```

##### Testing Releases

```bash
deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/testing/ wheezy main
deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/testing/ wheezy main
```

#### 5\. Fetch new sources and install Crate

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install crate
```

Verify that you have installed Crate and it's running:

```bash
sudo service crate status
```

### Debian Jessie

#### 3\. Add Backports and Crate repository to sources list

Next, add the Crate repository to _/etc/apt/sources.list_. Also add the `jessie-backports` repository to sources so that the Java 8 dependency can be resolved automatically.

```bash
deb http://http.debian.net/debian jessie-backports main
```

##### Stable Releases

```bash
deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/stable/ jessie main
deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/stable/ jessie main
```

##### Testing Releases

```bash
deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/testing/ jessie main
deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/testing/ jessie main
```

#### 4\. Fetch new sources and install Crate

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install crate
sudo systemctl enable crate
```

Verify that you have installed Crate and it's running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status crate
```

## Red Hat

The Crate Team maintains the official YUM repositories for RPM-based releases, supporting Linux Distributions such as RedHat Enterprise Linux 6, CentOS 6 and Scientific Linux 6.

### RHEL6

#### Enable the Crate YUM repository

All Crate packages are signed with GPG. To verify packages, you must install the public key and then install the _.rpm_ containing the YUM repository definition.

```bash
sudo rpm --import https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-crate
sudo rpm -Uvh https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/6/x86_64/crate-release-6.5-1.noarch.rpm
```

##### Testing and Unstable Releases

The Crate Testing repository is disabled by default, it contains development builds and is frequently updated. The packages are waiting for feedback from testers on functionality and stability. Packages in this repository will change during development, so you should disable it on production systems. If you want to enable the Testing repo on your server, set `enabled=1` in _/etc/yum.repos.d/crate.repo_.

#### Install Crate

```bash
yum install crate
```

#### Start Crate

```bash
sudo service crate start
```

### RHEL7

The Crate Team maintains the official YUM repositories for RPM-based releases. It's supported on Linux Distributions such as RedHat Enterprise Linux 7, CentOS 7, or Scientific Linux 7.

#### Enable the Crate YUM repository

All Crate packages are signed with GPG. To verify packages, you must install the public key and then you can install the _.rpm_ containing the YUM repository definition.

```bash
sudo rpm --import https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-crate
sudo rpm -Uvh https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/7/noarch/crate-release-7.0-1.noarch.rpm
```

#### Install Crate

```bash
sudo yum install crate
```

#### Start Crate

```bash
sudo systemctl start crate.service
```

## Ubuntu

We build packages for the Ubuntu versions Yakkety Yak (16.10), Xenial Xerus (16.04), Trusty Tahr (14.04) and Precise Pangolin (12.04). They are available on our [Launchpad page](https://launchpad.net/~crate). Adding the repository and installing Crate requires the following commands:

### Install Java 8

Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 do not officially ship with Java 8, so you have to [install it via a 3rd party repository](https://crate.io/docs/install/local/linux/#debian-wheezy)

### Install Crate

Adding a PPA repository requires `python-software-properties` to be installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
```

Ubuntu >= **16.x** additionally requires `software-properties-common`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
```

Then it's possible to add the Crate repository using `add-apt-repository` and install Crate:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:crate/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install crate
```

### Start Crate

Crate should have been started automatically by upstart and you can stop or restart it with:

```bash
sudo service crate stop
sudo service crate restart
```

### Testing and Unstable Releases

The Crate Testing repository is disabled by default, it contains development builds and is frequently updated. The packages are waiting for feedback from testers on functionality and stability. Packages in this repository will change during development, so it should be disabled on production systems. If you want to enable the Testing repo on your server. To enable the Testing Repository on your machine add the PPA:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:crate/testing
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install crate
```

**Important:** Crate requires the latest Java 8 (at least u20 or higher). To run Crate on Ubuntu releases older than 14.10 you would need to install Java 8 from the [Ubuntu Backports](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports) repository.

## Setting Environment Variables

On Ubuntu, Debian and RHEL systems the Crate startup script sources environment variables, such as `CRATE_HEAP_SIZE` or `CRATE_JAVA_OPTS` that you define in _/etc/default/crate_.

### Example

```bash
# Heap Size (defaults to 256m min, 1g max)
CRATE_HEAP_SIZE=2g

# Maximum number of open files, defaults to 65535.
# MAX_OPEN_FILES=65535

# Maximum locked memory size. Set to "unlimited" if you use the
# bootstrap.mlockall option in crate.yml. You must also set
# CRATE_HEAP_SIZE.
MAX_LOCKED_MEMORY=unlimited

# Additional Java OPTS
# CRATE_JAVA_OPTS=

# Force the JVM to use IPv4 stack
CRATE_USE_IPV4=true
```
