title: Install Crate on Mac
author: Chris Ward

You can install and run Crate on a Mac with one simple command in your terminal application:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -L try.crate.io)"
```

To create a cluster, run the command multiple times to create new instances that will discover each when running on the same machine.
