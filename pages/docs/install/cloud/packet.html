title: Getting started with Crate on Packet
author: Claus Matzinger

[Packet](https://www.packet.net) is a bare metal provider built for the next
generation of production workloads. Their emphasis on API-centered cloud
deployment, fast networking, and container-ready hardware make them a good
choice for developers and production workloads - and perfect for Crate clusters!

## Create your CRATE project

Packet organizes machines as projects which bundle together several deployments:

- Servers
- Storage
- Network

![Packet: Projects]({% static '/static/images/packet-project.png' %})

To get started, create a new project called 'Crate' (or any name of your
choosing) and deploy some machines. We recommend
[Type-1](https://www.packet.net/bare-metal/) servers, which are powerful enough
to handle medium to large workloads.

## Manual Provisioning

Start by choosing CoreOS, Ubuntu, Debian, or CentOS as an operating system for
your deployment. After the server is ready, Packet's IaaS machines behave just
like any other machine. Make sure to deploy an SSH key to access the server and
follow our guide [here](/docs/install/local/linux/).

### Provisioning with an Ansible Inventory

For creating consistent results we recommended you use
[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), or any similar platforms for configuring
and managing computers and simplifies the provisioning of Crate nodes.

To set up an inventory, Packet's API make it easy to fetch the IP addresses, and
hostnames, etc. to generate an 'Inventory' file. For your convenience, we have
already created a [simple
generator](https://github.com/crate/mesos-deploy/blob/c/crate-packet/PacketInventory.py).
With a 'Playbook' following Crate's [installation
instructions](https://crate.io/docs/install/local/linux/) a cluster is up and
running in minutes!
