title: Getting started with Crate on Packet
author: Claus Matzinger

[Packet](https://www.packet.net) is a bare metal provider built for the next
generation of production workloads. Their emphasis on API-centered cloud
deployment, fast networking, and container-ready hardware make them a good
choice for developers and production workloads - and perfect for Crate clusters!

## Create your Crate Project

Packet organizes machines as projects which bundle together several types of deployments:

- Servers
- Storage
- Network

To get started, create a new project called 'Crate' (or any name of your
choosing) and deploy some machines. For production use, we recommend
[Type-1](https://www.packet.net/bare-metal/) servers, which are powerful enough
to handle medium to large workloads.

![Packet: Servers]({% static '/static/images/0916/packet-servers.png' %})

Start by choosing an operating system for your deployment. After the server
is ready, Packet's IaaS machines behave just like any other machine. Make
sure to deploy an SSH key to access the server and after the machines are ready,
SSH access can be obtained by logging in with `ssh root@<public-ip>`. From there
it's just as any other Linux machine and there are several ways to install
Crate on the machine(s). Check out our guide
[for installing Crate on Linux.](/docs/install/local/linux/).
