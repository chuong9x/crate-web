title: Getting Started with Crate on Docker
author: Chris Ward

Docker allows developers to package applications and dependencies into standard, shippable units, great for easy deployments across platforms and constantly changing needs. Crate is available as a Docker image and is a perfect data store for Docker based applications.

if you don't have Docker setup yet, find [instructions for all platforms here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

## Kitematic
Kitematic is Docker's visual interface for creating Docker instances on Windows and Mac. Crate can be found in the list of default images in Kitematic.

Click the *Create* button and Kitematic will download the image file from Docker hub and by default set port allocation between Docker and the host machine automatically.

![kitematic overview]({% media '/media/1512/kitematic.png' %})

![Downloading image]({% media '/media/1512/kitematic-dl.png' %})

To override settings for a Docker instance, click the *Settings* tab. For example to manually allocate ports and set a shared volume between Docker and the local machine, make the following changes:

![Assign Ports]({% media '/media/1512/kitematic-ports.png' %})

![Assign Volumes]({% media '/media/1512/kitematic-vol.png' %})

## Command Line
### Fetch Crate Image
To use the command line to create Crate instances, first fetch the latest Crate image.

```bash
docker pull crate
```

Specify versions of the image by applying the `:version*number` tag.

### Start Crate Instances.

```bash
docker run -P -d crate
docker run -P -d crate
docker run -d -p 4200:4200 -p 4300:4300 crate
```

In this example we create three instances. The first two let Docker set the port allocation between Docker and the host automatically and one sets ports manually. These three instances will discover each other automatically.

Then visit your Docker IP address on port 4200, e.g. *http://DOCKER_IP:4200/admin*

The above is a simple example, to make better use of Crate with Docker, we should set some other parameters.

```bash
docker run -d -p 4200:4200 -p 4300:4300
  -v <data-dir>:/data crate
  crate -Des.config=/path/to/crate.yml
        -Des.cluster.name=cluster
```

This starts a Crate Docker instance that maps the data storage path to a location shared between the Docker container and the host system (The value of `<data-dir>`). This helps data remain consistent and persistent as container instances come and go on a local machine.

We also set a path to the Crate config file for fine grained settings changes, and give the cluster a name.

Docker has more configuration options Crate can leverage, [read about them here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/). Any [Crate specific settings](https://crate.io/docs/stable/configuration.html) are set using the `crate -Des.` prefix.

## Docker Compose
Docker's [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) tool allows developers to configure complex Docker-based applications that can then be started with one `docker-compose up` command.

Read about Docker Compose specifics [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). In this example we will start a node.js container that connects to a two instance Crate cluster.

```yaml
crate:
  image: crate
  ports:
    - "4200:4200"
    - "4300:4300"
  volumes:
    - /mnt/data/crate:/data
  environment:
    CRATE_HEAP_SIZE: 16g
  command: crate -Des.config=/path/to/crate.yml -Des.cluster.name=cluster
crate2:
  image: crate
  volumes:
    - /mnt/data/crate:/data
node:
  build: .
  ports:
    - "8000:8000"
  links:
    - crate
```

Here we create one Crate instance with the ports manually allocated, a shared file system volume, an environment variable set for the heap size and override the default Crate command to give the cluster a name and a config file. We then create another instance that joins the other in a cluster and a node.js instance that links to a Crate instance.

## Docker Machine and Swarm
Crate works with any Docker instances created with the [Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/) tool. Combined with Docker's cluster tool, [Swarm](https://www.docker.com/docker-swarm), Crate becomes a powerful companion to Docker. Setting up Crate as part of a Docker Swarm is a little more complicated, but we have [a guide](/docs/scale/docker_swarm/) to get you started.
