Crate takes your data seriously and we prioritize any resilience specific issues. Below are a list of the current issues flagged as related to resilience in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/crate/crate/issues):

If you’re interested in Crate’s underlying storage, distribution, and durability/consistency architecture, you might find the following informative:

 - [Crate Storage and Consistency](/docs/reference/storage_consistency.html) – from the Crate documentation. Understand the Crate approach and some of the design trade offs we make to balance consistency and performance for the customer user cases we support.
 - [Crate and Elasticsearch](/a/sql-for-elasticsearch/) – Crate's clustering layer leverages Elasticsearch libraries, which intertwines Crate and [Elasticsearch recilience](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/resiliency/current/index.html).
