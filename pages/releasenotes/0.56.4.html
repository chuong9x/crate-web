# Crate 0.56.4

18 Nov 2016


 - Fixed a race condition that could cause join statements or statements with a
    very high limit to get stuck or result in a "Same bucket of a page set more
    than once" error.
    

 - ``COPY FROM`` now correctly resolves files within symlinked folders when a
    wildcard is used in the path.
    

 - Fixed an issue that caused join query to get stuck when an
    expression evaluation related to both relations caused an error.
    

 - Fixed inconsistency in the calculation of low/high disk watermark
    thresholds for node checks and logs.
    

 - Fixed an issue with certain subselects which led to incorrect results.
    (E.g.: ``select sum(x) from (select x from t limit 1)``)
    

 - Fixed an issue which prevented inserting data using the ``COPY FROM``
    statement into tables created with the ``CLUSTERED BY`` clause.
    

 - Fixes evaluation of `OR` expressions if one argument evaluates to
    `true` and the other results in an error.
    

 - Fix: Prevent adding columns with restricted names to dynamic objects
    

 - Reduced the memory requirement for update and delete statements which only
    affect a small subset of a table
    

 - Fixed an issue that caused the ``WHERE`` clause of queries on ``unnest(..)``
    to be ignored.
    

 - Fixed NPE in the ``percentile`` aggregation fucntion. The NPE was occurring
    in case when queried shards have no records.
    

 - Fixed an issue with select queries returning duplicate outputs
    when `where` uses `=` with `primary key` and an order by which is
    also part of the selected fields is used.
    

 - Fixed adding a column to an existing object array using `ALTER TABLE`
    

 - Fix: selecting os_info['jvm']['vm_vendor'] and os_info['jvm']['name'] caused
    ColumnUnknownExceptions
    

 - Removed reduced thread stack size java option, stack size defaults
    to JVM defaults now.
    

 - Fixed an issue that causes outer joins to fail with an exception
    if columns are referenced in a where clause but not as select items.
    

 - Fixed an issue that caused right outer joins to get stuck instead of returning
    a result if the left table is empty.
    

 - Fixed an issue that caused left outer joins to return an empty result if the
    joined table is empty.
    

 - Fix: Certain subselects with nested ``order by`` and ``limit`` or ``offset``
    produced incorrect results.
    eg. select * from (select a, b from t1 order by a limit 3) as t order by b limit 2
