# Crate 0.55.4

16 Aug 2016


 - Fixed a NPE in ordered select statements.
    

 - Fix: Inserting a duplicate primary key lead to an update on
    replicas even though it resulted in a DuplikateKeyException
    (introduced with version 0.55.0).
    

 - Fix: Querying a partitioned table by a single primary key raised an
    exception instead of responding whith a zero row count.
    

 - Improved the performance of sorted join queries
