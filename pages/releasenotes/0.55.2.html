# Crate 0.55.2

07 Jul 2016


 - Fix: selecting ``os['timestamp']`` multiple times in same ``sys.nodes``
    statement could result in different values.
    

 - Fix: selecting ``os``, ``network``, ``fs`` or ``process`` from ``sys.nodes``
    in very quick succession or multiple times in same select statement
    could lead to wrong results for percentual values from the underlying sigar
    library.
    

 - Fixed performance issues with arithmetic operators and functions.
    

 - Fixed duplicate key error handling for multiple row inserts. Instead of
    responding with an error the number of affected row is adjusted.
    

 - Fixed a NPE that occurred when inserting null values to a generated column.
