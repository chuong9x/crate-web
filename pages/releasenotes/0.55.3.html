# Crate 0.55.3

05 Aug 2016


 - Fixed an issue which prevents java client from running explain
    statements.
    

 - Fixed an issue which caused `current_timestamp` as part of a generated
    expression to not work correctly.
    This fix will only affect new tables. Tables which already contain a
    generated column which uses `current_timestamp` will need to be recreated.
    

 - Improved error handling when grouping by invalid data types.
    

 - Fixed an issue when ordering by a function on a joined query.
    

 - Fixed an issue which could lead to wrong Error messages due to a
    race condition.
    

 - Fix: Arrays of geo_point can be used in insert/update
    statements as literals as well as bind arguments.
    

 - Fix: If a graceful shutdown of a node was aborted, sql statement
    processing on that node was still disabled.
    

 - Fixed a read isolation issue which could cause joins involving
    system and blob tables to return inconsistent results.
    

 - BREAKING: On Hunspell dictionary configuration, the parameter
    indices.analysis.hunspell.dictionary.location has been removed and <path.conf>/hunspell
    is always used.
    

 - Fixed a bug that prevented join and sort on blob tables.
    

 - Adapted behaviour of stats.enabled, stats.jobs_log_size and stats.operations_log_size settings
    to match behaviour of other cluster wide settings like for example minimum_master_nodes.
    

 - Fix: Do not fetch table stats when node is not fully available yet.
    This could have led to NullPointerExceptions during long recovery
    process on node start.
    

 - Fixed an issue which prevented running join queries on empty partitioned
    tables.
    

 - Fix: the ``hostname`` column of the ``sys.nodes`` table returns a hostname
    instead of an IP address.
    

 - Fixed an issue that caused select statements to get stuck if used as part of
    a bulk request. Now a proper error is raised.
    

 - Updated Elasticsearch to 2.3.4
    

 - Fix: the ``within`` scalar function now allows querying geo_shapes within
    geo_shapes.
