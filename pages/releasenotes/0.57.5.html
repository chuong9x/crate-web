# Crate 0.57.5

06 Dec 2016


 - Fixed a rare race condition that could happen on select queries during a
    shard relocation leading to a `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` or a wrong
    result.
    

 - Fix: Creating new partitions could have failed in case the partitioned table
    was created prior to CrateDB version ``0.55.0`` and the table contained a
    ``object`` column.
    

 - Fixed issue in joins with 3 or more tables where limit was applied
    before `where` clause filtering which produced  wrong results.
    

 - Fixed runtime error handling which could cause queries to get stuck
    on failures.
    

 - Fixed issue which causes ``BETWEEN`` to return a wrong result if
    ``min`` or ``max`` is null.
