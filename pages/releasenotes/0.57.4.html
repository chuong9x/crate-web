# Crate 0.57.4

30 Nov 2016


 - Fixed ClassCastException that occurs when executing queries with
    `order by` that uses scalar functions which have integer return type
    and null values are involved in the ordering.
    e.g. ``SELECT * from t1 ORDER BY abs(col1)`` (col1 contains nulls)
    

 - Fixed NPE that that can occur in join queries when left table
    has no matching records.
    

 - Fixed issue that caused join queries to get stuck when killed.
    

 - Improved error message when column is missing from `group by`
    by using the column alias instead of the column name.
    

 - Improve error message for not supported set operations
    `intersect` and `except`.
    

 - Improved error handling:
    Sometimes a user would get a "Job Killed" error instead of the actual error
    that caused a query to get interrupted.
    

 - Fixed a memory leak that was caused by blob uploads.
