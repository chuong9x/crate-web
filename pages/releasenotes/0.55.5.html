# Crate 0.55.5

19 Sep 2016


 - Fix: Dropping a partition while inserting by primary key into same
    partition should not raise an exception but returns a 0 row count instead.
    

 - Fix: JAR conflict if HDFS plugin with Hadoop 2.x is used.
    

 - Fix: Now it is also possible to restore a snapshot of a single partition
    of a partitioned table in a non-existent table.
    This requires that the snapshot has been created with version ``0.55.5``
    or greater!
    

 - Fix: Join conditions were not properly validated and an expression
    with a not yet defined relation could be used.
    

 - Fix: Setting of a default schema was not possible by using the HTTP REST
    endpoint.
    

 - Fix: Error was thrown in case of primary key bulk delete statement
    with null bulk arguments.
    

 - Fix: Return 0 rows instead of an error when executing select queries
    that try to match null for primary key columns.
    eg: select * from t where pk in (null);
    

 - Fix: Allow select statements on columns of multiple nested object array
    

 - Fix: do not allow to create tables in read-only system schemas
    

 - Fix: `COPY FROM` statements fail if null values are inserted into partitioned
    tables.
    

 - Fix: type was not set correctly when creating a token filter
    with default name and no type
    

 - Fix: prevent creating `char filters` with missing properties
